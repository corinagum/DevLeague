#Multiples of 3 and 5

##Your Mission

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Clone this project, write the body of the function **sumOfAMultiple** in your `multiples.js` file so that the tests pass.
The function will return the sum of all the multiples of **3** or **5** below **n**.

There are **4** tests in `multiples-spec.js`, once your first two tests pass, uncomment the last two and fill in the correct result.

# Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. run the command: `npm install`
3. Open this repository in your text editor of your choice.
4. Your work will be done in the file named: `multiples.js`
5. There are tests in place to check your work. To run these tests, run the command: `npm test`
6. Once you have two tests passing, open the test spec file `multiples_spec.js` and un-comment the last two tests.
7. These last two tests were written incorrectly, fix them!
